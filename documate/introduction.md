# Welcome to Documate v0.1.0

Documate is a minimal static site generator for docs that takes your Markdown-based code and
outputs a beautiful site (like this). The reason for using Markdown is simply because HTML-based
docs (JSX, EJS, etc as well) seem to be cluttery with all the unnecessary tags that remove
brevity and make readability a pain.

Another bonus of using Markdown is that any GitHub docs of your previous projects (in Markdown)
can be put into a site with Documate. All you need is to run two commands and then you deploy.
Although Documate can't deploy your builds for you, your builds are made production-ready and
your readers can enjoy reading along.

## Features

- **Markdown-only** - You can embed HTML content in your Markdown files as usual
- **Minimal** - Documate is not opinionated about how you lay out or format your docs. In any case,
it knows how to transpile your Markdown 1-1 to HTML.
- **Responsive** - Your site will look stunningly responsive and immersive across different viewports
- **Blazing fast serving** - Run `documate start` and view your docs locally in no time
- **Production-ready builds** - Your builds are minified and scripts uglified. Thanks to [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/)

Without much further to say, [let's get started](/getting-started)!
