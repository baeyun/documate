<p>Documate is a simple <em>static documentation generator</em> that renders your Markdown files
into a beautiful HTML site that you could then deploy to a server or some serverless
cloud.</p>

<h1 id="f-tF8AHisnJf4H7K~installation">Installation</h1>
<p>To be able to use Documate, you just have to install it globally:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install -g documate
  # or
$ yarn add documate --global
</code></pre>
<h1 id="f-tF8AHisnJf4H7K~usage">Usage</h1>
<p>The basic commands include:</p>
<pre><code># Create an empty project
$ documate init my-cool-docs

# Run your awesome docs (run from project root)
$ documate start

# Build your docs (run from project root)
$ documate build
</code></pre>
<p>Your docs should appear in the <code>./documate/</code> folder. You can reference any Markdown file to
include in your docs. Just don't edit any file/folder that is created during runtime.</p>
<h2 id="f-tF8AHisnJf4H7K~thenavmdfile">The <code>nav.md</code> file</h2>
<p>Okay. So this is your main file you'll be referencing quite much. It is so simple to say that it's
just but a tweakable (fully-responsive) navbar that is docked to the left side of your screen. It's
a list of Markdown links that could point to any given URL in your site. Sweet right?</p>
<p>Furthermore, only links that have been interacted with will load particular content (we call <em>partials</em> - long story why we called it such) at a time. If your user's browser is smart enough to cache fetched content, they are gonna have an excellent experience.</p>
<h2 id="f-tF8AHisnJf4H7K~offlinecapabilitiespwastrategiesserviceworkersetc">Offline capabilities? (PWA strategies, service workers, etc)</h2>
<p>Implementing <code>ServiceWorker</code> is a priceless feature we will be adding soon. Keep up with the updates and
your site will be given offline support (on user-prompt included as well)!</p>
<h2 id="f-tF8AHisnJf4H7K~deploying">Deploying</h2>
<p>This feature is yet to come. Please support us to have this feature ready in sooner.</p>
