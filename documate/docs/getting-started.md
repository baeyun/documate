# Getting Started

Now that you understand what Documate is and does, let's learn how it's done.

## Installation (CLI)

Since we will be dealing with simple commands like `init`, `serve` and `build`, we need a CLI tool. So with Node installed, simple run:

```bash
$ npm install -g documate # Using npm

$ yarn add --global documate # or with Yarn
```

## Creating your first Documate project

Now that you have Documate CLI installed, simple run the following commands in the root directory of your project:

```bash
$ documate init # To initialize a basic/empty project

$ documate start # To serve your docs
```

After you serve your docs, head over to `localhost:3000` to view the site.

## Building your Documate project

Run the following command to build your docs:

```bash
$ documate build
```
