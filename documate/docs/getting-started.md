# Getting Started

Now that you understand what Documate is and does, let's learn how it's done.

## Installation (CLI)

Since we will be dealing with simple commands like `init`, `serve` and `build`, we need a CLI tool. So with Node installed, simple run:

```bash
# Using npm
$ npm install -g documate

# or with Yarn
$ yarn add --global documate
```

## Creating your first Documate project

Now that you have Documate CLI installed, simple run the following commands in the root directory of your project:

```bash
# To initialize a basic/empty project
$ documate init

# To serve your docs
$ documate start

# To build your docs
$ documate build
```

After you serve your docs, head over to `localhost:3000` to view the site.
