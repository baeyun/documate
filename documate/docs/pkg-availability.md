# pkg-availability
<small>A package availability checker for npm packages</small>

**pkg-availability** is a CLI too for checking npm package name availability. I wrote it as a weekend project to help easen the daunting process of searching for package names one by one on npm. With this tool, I just paste in a list of names and it does the checking. It then outputs a pretty list with details on the availability of each package name.

### Installation

To start using this tool, install it with npm follows:
`npm i -g pkg-availibity`

You could also install via yarn:
`yarn global add pkg-availibity`

*Enjoy!*
