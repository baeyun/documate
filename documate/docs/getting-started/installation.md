# Installation

You need to install Documate globally and not as a project dependency so that you get access to the Documate CLI. Either ways, your Markdown docs will still reside in your project docs folder.

With Node installed, run:

```bash
npm install -g documate
```

With this command, you'll have Documate's CLI globally installed.
