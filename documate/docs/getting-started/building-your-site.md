# Building your project's docs

There are two phases to this section:

- Building your docs (Documate handles this)
- Building a site out of your final HTML (transferred to webpack)

To build your project's docs, run:

```bash
documate build
```

This creates a folder called `website` in the `documate` folder of your project's root directory. During deployment, just set the public path to `/documate/website` and your site is ready.

Together with what you've learnt so far, this pretty much sums up all you need to know about Documate. If you have any issues, make sure to submit to [Documate's issues](https://github.com/bukharim96/documate/issues) section. We are always ready to accept any contributions. Just make sure you read through [the Contribution Guidelines](/docs/contributing) before

Thanks to [@bukharim96](https://twitter.com/bukharim96/) for building the entire Documate CLI and [@undefinedbuddy](https://twitter.com/undefinedbuddy/) for rocking the docs & UI. Feel free to ask these cool guys just about anything on Documate.
