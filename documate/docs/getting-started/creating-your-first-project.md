# Creating your first project with Documate

For this step, you just need to know of the `init` and `start` commands.

## Prerequisites

Your app must be either:

- A non-ejected CRA app, or
- An ejected CRA app with a CRA-compatible webpack configuration.

To find more about CRA's ejecting rules, check [their site](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject).

By now, you should have Documate CLI globally installed. If not, [follow these procedures](/docs/getting-started/installation). To create a new app, just run:

```bash
documate init
```

in the root of your project folder. This initializes the dummy pages of your docs. Before we start editing, run:

```bash
documate start
```

Again, from the root directory of your project.
