<p>Documate is a minimal static site generator for docs that takes your Markdown-based code and
outputs a beautiful site (like this). The reason for using Markdown is simply because HTML-based
docs (JSX, EJS, etc as well) seem to be cluttery with all the unnecessary tags that remove
brevity and make readability a pain.</p>
<p>Another bonus of using Markdown is that any GitHub docs of your previous projects (in Markdown)
can be put into a site with Documate. All you need is to run two commands and then you deploy.
Although Documate can't deploy your builds for you, your builds are made production-ready and
your readers can enjoy reading along.</p>
