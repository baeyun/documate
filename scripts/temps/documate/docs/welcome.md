# Welcome

Edit `/documate/docs/welcome.md` (in the root directory of your project) to change this content. You may also simply delete it and start fresh by creating new Markdown files in the `/documate/docs/` directory and adding them to the `navs.DOCS` property of the `/documate/config.js` file.

For more details check out our [docs](https://documate.netlify.com/docs/).

Happy *documating*!
